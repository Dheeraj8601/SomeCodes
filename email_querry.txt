I hope this email finds you well. I have a quick question about the upcoming interview scheduled for 13-09-2022.

Could you please clarify whether it is necessary to bring my resume in a file or if it's sufficient to have it printed on standard resume paper? Additionally, should I bring any additional copies of my resume or other documents?
